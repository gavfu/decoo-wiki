## Endpoint
https://api.decoo.io/pinning/pinByHash

## Description
Asynchronously pin an IPFS content to Decoo cloud by its content identifier. Each API call will generate a *pin job*, which will be picked and processed by a periodically running job. You can query the status of the job using [pinJobs](pinning/pin-jobs.mdx) API.


:::note
In order for the job to be successfully processed, the content for the hash you provide must already be pinned by another node on the IPFS network.
